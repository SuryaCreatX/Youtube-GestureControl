### GESTURE BASED YOUTUBE CONTROL

# Intro
Gesture-based interfaces are systems that allow users to interact with them by using hand or other body components. These applications are getting more and more popular and have a wide range of use cases; for example in home automation, healthcare, automative, virtual reality, etc. If well designed, gesture-based interfaces feel more natural, intuitive and easier to learn.

The goal of this project is to use simple python libraries to recognise a set of hand gestures and use those to interact with a YouTube player. Additionally, if the user is sleeping or has left, the player will get paused automatically. Here is a demo!!!

Why Youtube player, you might ask? Well, it's popular, there is no need to install a software locally, you can find pretty much any kind of visual content and it's free (as long as you're ok with advertisement ðŸ˜‰).
But of course, you can implement the same technique to control a local media player or anything else; just make sure the application allows for keyboard shortcuts or has an API.
